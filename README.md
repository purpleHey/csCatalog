# csCatalog

It's difficult to find what CS Courses are offered in high school, and this project endeavors
to crowd source the creation of such a beast.  In the long run the goal is to build a system
that allows user to not only share their curriculum's, but to provide feedback and lessons
leaned to improve the courses over time.

These ideas are clearly in their infancy.

It's built on Angular, and get's data from files for now, and it read only.
